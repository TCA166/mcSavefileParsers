# cNBT files

These are files from the cNBT repository that are absolutely needed for parsing of the raw nbt data.
It's a very cool library (and I'm very grateful it exists). Check it out here:[cNBT](https://github.com/chmod222/cNBT/tree/master).
Thankfully also they can be straight up here with no issues thanks to the awesome license chosen which greatly simplifies everything.
