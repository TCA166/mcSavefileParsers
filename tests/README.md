# Tests

So here are the actual tests for the libraries located.
They are coded in C ofc, however in order to simplify the usage of [Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/) I chose to use their checkmk utility and it's C dialect.
Writing tests is already tedious enough, I don't have to make it harder on myself now do I.
I don't have much experience writing tests, all suggestions are welcome.

## Hashes for test files

Since I use files in some tests here are the sha256 hashes for the files:

- 8583b9137dc65f5e04e36f19dd247d1159d519617028b4a3f4b3ddf02ecd8627  r.0.0.mca
